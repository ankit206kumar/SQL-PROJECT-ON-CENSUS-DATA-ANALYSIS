# SQL-PROJECT-ON-CENSUS-DATA-ANALYSIS

This project involves the design and implementation of SQL queries to analyze census data.
The objective is to extract meaningful insights from a large dataset containing demographic information such as population, gender, sex ratio, population growth, literacy rate , and geographic location. 
Key tasks include data cleaning, filtering, aggregation, and the creation of complex queries to identify trends and patterns within the population.
